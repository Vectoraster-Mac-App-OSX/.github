## 📊 Overview  

Vectoraster is a specialized design tool created for generating high-quality halftones, raster patterns, and modular vector-based graphics. Built for artists, illustrators, designers, and visual researchers, it transforms images, gradients, and mathematical parameters into fully editable vector artwork. Its core focus is procedural pattern creation—making it ideal for posters, branding, editorial graphics, motion design assets, and experimental digital art.

The engine behind Vectoraster enables real-time updates, allowing users to adjust parameters like point shapes, spacing, scaling, grid type, and randomness while instantly previewing the results. Whether you're creating noise-driven dot fields, geometric grids, or high-resolution halftone effects, the software provides fine-grained control over every visual variable.

Vectoraster supports a variety of grid systems—square, circular, triangular, radial, and custom grids—each with its own dynamic behavior. Users can drive pattern properties with image brightness, color values, gradients, or procedural functions, resulting in unique, data-driven compositions. Every point, line, or shape in a pattern is vector-based, making the output perfect for print, large-format design, and further editing in other creative tools.

The app also includes noise patterns, distortion effects, blending tools, and dynamic animation export options for motion graphics workflows. Finished designs can be exported as high-resolution vectors (EPS, PDF, SVG) or raster files (PNG, TIFF), supporting both artistic experimentation and professional production pipelines.

With its rich procedural toolkit and responsive interface, Vectoraster has become a go-to environment for designers who enjoy exploring structured randomness, modular art, and inventive halftone techniques.
